<h1>Known Bugs and Feature Requests in FLTK 1.3.5</h1>

<p>This is a list of open STR's (Software Trouble Reports) and RFE's
(Requests for Enhancement) at the time of the release of FLTK 1.3.5 (Jan. 2019).
The current list can be viewed online at FLTK's
<a href="https://www.fltk.org/roadmap.php#1.2">Development Roadmap</a>.
FLTK 1.3.5 is expected to be the last release in the 1.3.x series. Only
very serious bugs <b>may</b> be addressed in a future 1.3.6 release.
<br>
All open STR's and RFE's of FLTK 1.3.x will be considered for FLTK 1.4.0,
if possible.

<p>FLTK 1.3 is the LATEST STABLE BRANCH based on FLTK 1.1.10. It adds internationalization,
   UTF-8 (Unicode), printing support, Doxygen based documentation, and several new widgets
   including Fl_Native_File_Chooser, Fl_Table, and Fl_Tree. FLTK 1.3 is no longer in active
   development but still gets some important bug fixes (and for instance new macOS support).
